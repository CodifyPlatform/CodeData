### **§27-357 Exit Requirements**

The determination of exit requirements for a building shall be based upon the occupancy group classification of the building, the number of occupants, the floor area, the travel distance to an exit, and the capacity of the exits, as provided in [table 6-1](https://up.codes/viewer/new_york_city/nyc-building-code-1968-v1/chapter/6/means-of-egress#table_6-1) and herein. Every floor of a building shall be provided with exit facilities for its occupant load. The occupant loads of floors shall not be cumulative for the purpose of designing vertical exits, except where one floor is used by another as a means of egress. Vertical exits provided from any floor above grade may serve simultaneously all floors above grade, and vertical exits provided from any floor below grade may serve simultaneously all floors below grade.

#### a. Mixed occupancy. 

When a building is classified in more than one occupancy group in accordance with the provisions of [section 27-239](https://up.codes/viewer/new_york_city/nyc-building-code-1968-v1/chapter/3/occupancy-and-construction-classification#§27-239) of article two of subchapter three of this chapter, the exit requirements for the entire building shall be determined on the basis of the occupancy group having the strictest exit requirements, or the exit requirements for each building section shall be determined separately.

#### b. Incidental occupancies. 

When a building contains incidental occupancies classified in occupancy groups other than that under which the building is classified, the exit requirements for the floor on which such occupancies occur shall be based upon those of the occupancy group under which the building is classified; but the access and exit requirements for the incidental occupancy shall be based upon the occupancy group classification of the incidental occupancy.

#### c. Multiple occupancy or use. 

Where a building, floor, or space is used for multiple purposes involving different activities at different times, that occupancy involving the greatest number of occupants shall be used in determining the exit requirements.

#### d. Building access. 

All buildings classified in other than occupancy groups A, mechanical and electrical equipment rooms and boiler and furnace rooms of [D-2](https://up.codes/viewer/new_york_city/nyc-building-code-1968-v1/chapter/3/occupancy-and-construction-classification#§27-251) or [J-3](https://up.codes/viewer/new_york_city/nyc-building-code-1968-v1/chapter/3/occupancy-and-construction-classification#§27-266) shall have at least one primary entrance accessible to and usable by individuals who use wheelchairs. Such entrance shall provide access to a level that makes elevators available in buildings where elevators are provided. Where ramps are used to comply with this requirement, they shall have a slope not greater than one in twelve, and shall otherwise conform to the provisions of [section 27-377](https://up.codes/viewer/new_york_city/nyc-building-code-1968-v1/chapter/6/means-of-egress#§27-377) and reference standard RS 4-6.

The commissioner may waive the requirements of this section in the alteration of buildings existing on the effective date of this code in accordance with [section 27-292.6](https://up.codes/viewer/new_york_city/nyc-building-code-1968-v1/chapter/4/building-limitations#§27-292.6) of this code.

### **§27-358 Occupant Load**

The number of occupants for whom exit facilities shall be provided shall be established either (1) by the actual number of occupants for whom each occupied space, floor, or building, as the case may be, is designed, or (2) by using the appropriate occupant-area ratios from [table 6-2](https://up.codes/viewer/new_york_city/nyc-building-code-1968-v1/chapter/6/means-of-egress#table_6-2), whichever is larger. The occupant load of any space shall include the occupant load of all spaces that discharge through it in order to gain access to an exit.

#### (a) Unlisted occupancies. 

Where data regarding the sq. ft. per person for an occupancy is not listed in [table 6-2](https://up.codes/viewer/new_york_city/nyc-building-code-1968-v1/chapter/6/means-of-egress#table_6-2), the occupant load shall be established by an architect or engineer, subject to the approval of the commissioner.

#### (b) Modifications.

(1) When the actual occupant load of any space will be significantly lower than that listed in [table 6-2](https://up.codes/viewer/new_york_city/nyc-building-code-1968-v1/chapter/6/means-of-egress#table_6-2), the commissioner may establish a lower basis for the determination of the occupant load.

(2) When a building existing on December sixth, nineteen hundred sixty-eight is altered or changed in occupancy or use so as to require enlarged exit facilities, the commissioner may authorize the alteration or change in occupancy or use without an enlargement of exit facilities, provided the occupant load is limited to that accommodated by the existing exit facilities as determined by the provisions of this code, and the building or space is posted accordingly with a sign. Such signs shall be at least twelve inches in width and sixteen inches in height. The lettering shall be red on a white background. The letters shall be not less than one inch high and the numerals not less than one and one-quarter inches high.

#### (c) Nonsimultaneous occupancy.

The occupant load of toilets, locker rooms, meeting rooms, storage rooms, employee cafeterias, and similar rooms or spaces that are not occupied at the same time as other rooms or spaces on the same floor of a building, may be omitted from the occupant load calculation of the floor on which they are located to the extent that such spaces serve occupied rooms on the same floor.

### **§27-359 Capacity of Exits**

The capacity of exits and access facilities shall be measured in units of width of twenty-two inches, and the number of persons per unit of width shall be determined by the occupancy group classification and type of exit as listed in [table 6-1](https://up.codes/viewer/new_york_city/nyc-building-code-1968-v1/chapter/6/means-of-egress#table_6-1). Fractions of a unit of width less than twelve inches shall not be credited. Where twelve inches or more are added to one or more full units of width, one-half unit of width may be credited. Where computations of total required width give fractional results, the next larger integral number of exit units or integral number plus one-half, shall be used. A fraction less than one-half may be neglected in cases where such fraction constitutes less than ten per cent of the total required number of units. Notwithstanding any of the above computations, no exit or access facility shall be narrower than the minimum width requirements specified in [table 6-1](https://up.codes/viewer/new_york_city/nyc-building-code-1968-v1/chapter/6/means-of-egress#table_6-1), or elsewhere in this code.

### **§27-360 Travel Distance**

#### (a) General requirement. 

The maximum travel distance from the most remote point in any room or space to the center of a door opening directly on an open exterior space, a vertical exit, an interior stair, an exit passageway or to a horizontal exit shall not be greater than the limit specified in [table 6-1](https://up.codes/viewer/new_york_city/nyc-building-code-1968-v1/chapter/6/means-of-egress#table_6-1) for the occupancy group classification of the room or space.

#### (b) Travel distance within dwelling units. 

In buildings classified in occupancy groups [J-1](https://up.codes/viewer/new_york_city/nyc-building-code-1968-v1/chapter/3/occupancy-and-construction-classification#§27-264) and [J-2](https://up.codes/viewer/new_york_city/nyc-building-code-1968-v1/chapter/3/occupancy-and-construction-classification#§27-265), the maximum travel distance from the centerline of a door from any habitable room within a dwelling unit either to the centerline of a door opening on a corridor or to the center of a door opening on an exit shall not be greater than forty feet, except that for buildings classified in occupancy group [J-2](https://up.codes/viewer/new_york_city/nyc-building-code-1968-v1/chapter/3/occupancy-and-construction-classification#§27-265) of construction class I-A, the distance may be increased to fifty feet. Such travel distances shall be included in the maximum travel distance established in subdivision (a) of this section.

#### (c) Measurement. 

Travel distance shall be measured along a natural and unobstructed path of travel. Where the path of travel is over an access stair, it shall be measured along an inclined straight line through the center of the outer edge of each tread.

## **Article 3 Location of Exits**

### **§27-361 Arrangement**

All exits and access facilities shall be located so that they are clearly visible, or their locations clearly indicated, and they shall be kept readily accessible and unobstructed at all times.

### **§27-362 Tenant Spaces**

When more than one tenant occupies a building or floor area, each tenant shall have direct access to the required number of exits without passing through premises occupied by other tenants, except as permitted for balconies in subdivision (g) of [section 27-369](https://up.codes/viewer/new_york_city/nyc-building-code-1968-v1/chapter/6/means-of-egress#§27-369) of article five of this subchapter.

### **§27-363 Remote Location**

#### (a) When more than one exit is required from a floor of a building, 

each such required exit shall be placed as remote from the others as is practicable. Where this results in a distance between exits exceeding the maximum travel distances required by [section 27-357](https://up.codes/viewer/new_york_city/nyc-building-code-1968-v1/chapter/6/means-of-egress#§27-357), additional remote vertical exits shall be provided.

#### (b) In addition to the requirements of subdivision (a) of this section:

(1) For exits serving spaces classified in occupancy groups G or [J-2](https://up.codes/viewer/new_york_city/nyc-building-code-1968-v1/chapter/3/occupancy-and-construction-classification#§27-265), in no event shall such exits be less than fifteen feet distant from each other.

(2) For exits serving spaces classified in other occupancies, in no event shall such distance be less than thirty feet or one-third the maximum travel distance required by [section 27-357](https://up.codes/viewer/new_york_city/nyc-building-code-1968-v1/chapter/6/means-of-egress#§27-357), whichever is greater.

#### (c) On any floor containing ten thousand square feet or more in a high rise building classified in occupancy group E (office space), 

each exit that is required to be remote from another exit shall not share any common walls, floors, ceilings, scissor stair assemblies, or other enclosures.

### **§27-364 Exit Discharge**

All vertical exits shall extend in a continuous enclosure to discharge directly, or by way of a yard, court, or exit passageway, to an open exterior space. When vertical exits serving floors above grade continue in the same enclosure to serve floors below grade, the portion of such vertical exits above grade shall be separated from the portion below grade by construction having at least a one hour fire-resistance rating, with three-quarter hour self-closing doors opening in the direction of exit travel from the floors below grade, except that buildings classified in residential occupancy group [J-3](https://up.codes/viewer/new_york_city/nyc-building-code-1968-v1/chapter/3/occupancy-and-construction-classification#§27-266) and educational occupancy group G shall be exempt from this requirement.

## **Article 4 Number of Exits**

### **§27-365 Egress From Rooms and Spaces**

(a) There shall be at least two door openings, remote from each other and leading to exits, from every room or enclosed space in which the total occupant loads exceeds the number of persons listed in [table 6-3](https://up.codes/viewer/new_york_city/nyc-building-code-1968-v1/chapter/6/means-of-egress#table_6-3).

#### **[TABLE 6-3](https://up.codes/viewer/new_york_city/nyc-building-code-1968-v1/chapter/6/means-of-egress#table_6-3) MAXIMUM OCCUPANT LOAD— SPACES WITH ONE DOOR [Max. Occupant Load]\****

This section shall not be applicable to any new or altered place of assembly, except for such places of assembly in fully sprinklered office buildings which occupy less than twenty percent of the floor area occupied by the principal use.

## Article 5 Access Requirements and Exit Types

### **§27-368 General**

(a) Means of egress shall be provided for all buildings by one or more of the facilities listed below. Access and exit facilities not specifically covered in this section shall not be used to satisfy the exit requirements of this code. Fire escapes shall not be permitted on new construction, with the exception of group homes. Fire escapes may be used as exits on buildings existing on December sixth, nineteen hundred sixty-eight when such buildings are altered, subject to the approval of the commissioner, or as provided in subdivision (b) hereof. Elevators or escalators shall be provided in all new buildings exceeding four stories in height except that buildings or building sections classified in occupancy group [H-2](https://up.codes/viewer/new_york_city/nyc-building-code-1968-v1/chapter/3/occupancy-and-construction-classification#§27-262) exceeding one story in height and buildings or building sections classified in occupancy group G or [J-1](https://up.codes/viewer/new_york_city/nyc-building-code-1968-v1/chapter/3/occupancy-and-construction-classification#§27-264) exceeding two stories in height shall be provided with elevators.

(b) In group homes all floors used by children shall have alternate exits remotely located from each other and readily accessible to the occupants. Fire escapes shall be permitted as the second means of egress.

### **§27-369 Corridors**

Corridors shall be kept readily accessible and unobstructed at all times. Corridors shall be kept free of combustible contents except that in buildings classified in occupancy groups G, [H-1](https://up.codes/viewer/new_york_city/nyc-building-code-1968-v1/chapter/3/occupancy-and-construction-classification#§27-261) and [H-2](https://up.codes/viewer/new_york_city/nyc-building-code-1968-v1/chapter/3/occupancy-and-construction-classification#§27-262), combustible contents may be stored in noncombustible lockers and combustible bulletin boards meeting the requirements of table 5-4 shall be permitted.
