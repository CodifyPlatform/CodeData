## CHAPTER 3: BUILDING BLOCKS

## 301 General

### **301.1 Scope.** 

The provisions of Chapter 3 shall apply where required by Chapter 2 or where referenced by a requirement in this document.

## 302 Floor or Ground Surfaces

### **302.1 General.** 

Floor and ground surfaces shall be stable, firm, and slip resistant and shall comply with 302.

**EXCEPTIONS:**

**1.** Within animal containment areas, floor and ground surfaces shall not be required to be stable, firm, and slip resistant.

**2.** Areas of sport activity shall not be required to comply with 302.

> 

### **Advisory 302.1 General.** 

A stable surface is one that remains unchanged by contaminants or applied force, so that when the contaminant or force is removed, the surface returns to its original condition. A firm surface resists deformation by either indentations or particles moving on its surface. A slip-resistant surface provides sufficient frictional counterforce to the forces exerted in walking to permit safe ambulation.

### **302.2 Carpet.** 

Carpet or carpet tile shall be securely attached and shall have a firm cushion, pad, or backing or no cushion or pad. Carpet or carpet tile shall have a level loop, textured loop, level cut pile, or level cut/uncut pile texture. Pile height shall be 1/2 inch (13 mm) maximum. Exposed edges of carpet shall be fastened to floor surfaces and shall have trim on the entire length of the exposed edge. Carpet edge trim shall comply with 303.

### **Advisory 302.2 Carpet.** 

Carpets and permanently affixed mats can significantly increase the amount of force (roll resistance) needed to propel a wheelchair over a surface. The firmer the carpeting and backing, the lower the roll resistance. A pile thickness up to 1/2 inch (13 mm) (measured to the backing, cushion, or pad) is allowed, although a lower pile provides easier wheelchair maneuvering. If a backing, cushion or pad is used, it must be firm. Preferably, carpet pad should not be used because the soft padding increases roll resistance.

### **Figure 302.2 Carpet Pile Height**

### **302.3 Openings.** 

Openings in floor or ground surfaces shall not allow passage of a sphere more than 1/2 inch (13 mm) diameter except as allowed in 407.4.3, 409.4.3, 410.4, 810.5.3 and 810.10. Elongated openings shall be placed so that the long dimension is perpendicular to the dominant direction of travel.

**EXCEPTIONS:**

**1.** Animal containment areas shall not be required to comply with 303.

**2.** Areas of sport activity shall not be required to comply with 303.

### **Figure 303.2 Vertical Change in Level**

### **303.3 Beveled.** 

Changes in level between 1/4 inch (6.4 mm) high minimum and 1/2 inch (13 mm) high maximum shall be beveled with a slope not steeper than 1:2.

### **Advisory 303.3 Beveled.** 

A change in level of 1/2 inch (13 mm) is permitted to be 1/4 inch (6.4 mm) vertical plus 1/4 inch (6.4 mm) beveled. However, in no case may the combined change in level exceed 1/2 inch (13 mm). Changes in level exceeding 1/2 inch (13 mm) must comply with 405 (Ramps) or 406 (Curb Ramps).

![](https://storage.googleapis.com/codify-public-data/images/2010%20ADA%20-%20Chapter%203%20-%20Building%20Blocks/Figure%20303.3%20Beveled%20Change%20in%20Level.PNG)

Such changes in level are prohibited in required clear floor and ground spaces, turning spaces, and in similar spaces where people using wheelchairs and other mobility devices must park their mobility aids such as in wheelchair spaces, or maneuver to use elements such as at doors, fixtures, and telephones. The exception permits slopes not steeper than 1:48.

Where space beneath an element is included as part of clear floor or ground space or turning space, the space shall comply with 306. Additional space shall not be prohibited beneath an element but shall not be considered as part of the clear floor or ground space or turning space.

### **Advisory 306.1 General.** 

Clearances are measured in relation to the usable clear floor space, not necessarily to the vertical support for an element. When determining clearance under an object for required turning or maneuvering space, care should be taken to ensure the space is clear of any obstructions.

### **306.2 Toe Clearance.**

> #### **306.2.1 General.** 
>

> #### **306.3.1 General.** 
>
> Space under an element between 9 inches (230 mm) and 27 inches (685 mm) above the finish floor or ground shall be considered knee clearance and shall comply with 306.3.
>

## 307 Protruding Objects

### **307.1 General.** 

Protruding objects shall comply with 307.

Objects with leading edges more than 27 inches (685 mm) and not more than 80 inches (2030 mm) above the finish floor or ground shall protrude 4 inches (100 mm) maximum horizontally into the circulation path.

**EXCEPTION:** Handrails shall be permitted to protrude 4 1/2 inches (115 mm) maximum.

### **Advisory 307.2 Protrusion Limits.** 

When a cane is used and the element is in the detectable range, it gives a person sufficient time to detect the element with the cane before there is body contact. Elements located on circulation paths, including operable elements, must comply with requirements for protruding objects. For example, awnings and their supporting structures cannot reduce the minimum required vertical clearance. Similarly, casement windows, when open, cannot encroach more than 4 inches (100 mm) into circulation paths above 27 inches (685 mm).
