## **Article 2 Dead Loads**



### **§27-553 Construction Materials and Assembled Elements of Construction**

Except as provided in [section 27-555](https://up.codes/viewer/new_york_city/nyc-building-code-1968-v1/chapter/9/loads#§27-555) of this article, the dead load shall be the actual weight of the building materials or construction assemblies to be supported, computed from the unit weights given in reference standard RS 9-1. Where unit weights are not established in reference standard RS 9-1, the actual weights may be determined by analysis or from data in manufacturers' drawings or catalogs. Unit weights less than those given in reference standard RS 9-1 may be used only with approval of the commissioner.

### **§27-554 Service Equipment**

Provision shall be made for the weights of all building service equipment including plumbing stacks, piping, heating and air conditioning equipment, electrical equipment, elevators, elevator machinery, flues, and similar fixed equipment. The weights of such equipment (or the allowances therefor) shall be included in the dead load. The weight of equipment that is part of the occupancy of a given area shall be considered as live load. See also paragraph two of subdivision (b) and subdivision (d) of [section 27-557](https://up.codes/viewer/new_york_city/nyc-building-code-1968-v1/chapter/9/loads#§27-557) of article three of this subchapter.

### **§27-555 Partition Loads**

Weights of all partitions shall be considered, using either actual weights at locations shown on the plans or the equivalent uniform load given in subdivision (b) of this section.

#### (a) Actual loads.

Where actual partition weights are used, the uniform design live load may be omitted from the strip of floor area under each partition.

#### (b) Equivalent uniform load.

The equivalent uniform partition loads in reference standard RS 9-1 may be used in lieu of actual partition weights except for bearing partitions or partitions in toilet room areas (other than in one- and two-family dwellings), at stairs and elevators, and similar areas where partitions are concentrated. In such cases, actual partition weights shall be used in design. Except as otherwise exempted, equivalent uniform loads shall be used in areas where partitions are not definitely located on the plans, or in areas where partitions are subject to rearrangement or location.

## **Article 3 Live Loads**



### **§27-556 General**

In addition to the applicable dead, wind, and other loads, the building shall be designed for uniform live loads, for concentrated live loads, or for concurrent combinations of uniform and concentrated live loads, whichever produce the greatest stress.

### **§27-557 Floor Live Loads**

#### (a) Uniformly distributed live loads. 

The minimum design values established in reference standard RS 9-2 for various occupancies or uses shall be used subject to the provisions of subdivision (d) of this section. Where the occupancy or use of a space does not conform to any of those listed, the design load shall be determined by the architect or engineer subject to approval by the commissioner.

#### (b) Concentrated live loads.

1. The building framing shall be capable of supporting the concentrated live loads established in reference standard RS 9-2, placed so as to produce maximum stress.
2. Floors that support any items of machinery, electrical or mechanical equipment, or other concentrated live load in excess of one thousand pounds (including the weights of pads or bases) shall be designed to support such weight as a concentrated load or group of concentrated loads.

#### (c) Nonconcurrence.

1. When a concentrated live load is present, the uniformly distributed load may be considered to be omitted in the area occupied by the concentrated load.
2. Where reference standard RS 9-2 indicates that the concentrated live load is nonconcurrent with the uniform live load, it may be assumed that the total concentrated load is to be omitted when the uniform load is present and that the total uniform load is to be omitted when the concentrated load is present.

#### (d) Conformance. 

For purposes of determining that the magnitude of the actual live load conforms to or is less than the minimum design live load established in this section, the actual uniform live load shall be approximated by averaging the total load actually applied over a rectangular area of one hundred fifty square feet having no side less than eight feet.

## **Article 7 Distribution of Loads**



### **§27-578 Distribution of Vertical Loads**

Distribution of vertical loads to supporting members shall be determined on the basis of a recognized method of elastic analysis or system of coefficients of approximation. Elastic or inelastic displacements of supports shall be considered and, for the distribution of dead loads, the modulus of elasticity of concrete or composition sections shall be reduced to consider plastic flow. Secondary effects, due to warping of the floors shall be considered.

### **§27-579 Distribution of Horizontal Loads**

The following provisions shall apply to superstructure framing only, and shall not apply to structures wherein horizontal loads are transmitted to the foundation by stay-cables, arches, non-rectangular frames, or by frames, trusses, or shear walls not oriented in vertical planes.

#### (a) Distribution of horizontal loads to vertical frames, trusses and shear walls. 

Horizontal loads on the superstructure shall be assumed to be distributed to vertical frames, trusses, and shear walls by floor and roof systems acting as horizontal diaphragms. The proportion of the total horizontal load to be resisted by any given vertical frame, truss, or shear wall shall be determined on the basis of relative rigidity, considering the eccentricity of the applied load with respect to the center of resistance of the frames, trusses, or shear walls. For vertical trusses, web deformations shall be considered in evaluating the rigidity.

#### (b) Distribution of horizontal loads within rigid frames of tier buildings.

##### 1. ASSUMPTIONS. 

The distribution of horizontal loads within rigid frames of tier buildings may be determined on the basis of a recognized method of elastic analysis or, subject to limitations in paragraph two of this subdivision, may be predicated on one or more of the following simplifying assumptions:

a. Points of inflection in beams or columns are at their midspan and midheight, respectively. The story shear is distributed to the columns in proportion to their stiffnesses.

b. The change in length of columns due to axial effects of the horizontal loads may be neglected.

c. Vertical column loads due to horizontal forces are taken by the exterior columns only, or are resisted by the columns in proportion to the column distances from the neutral axis of the bent.

##### 2. LIMITATIONS.

a. For buildings over three hundred feet in height, the change in length of the columns, due to the effects of the horizontal loads, shall be evaluated or the framing proportioned to produce regular movements of the successive joints at each floor so that warping of the floor system may be neglected.

b. Simplifying assumptions used in design shall be subject to approval by the commissioner for any of the following conditions or circumstances:

1. For buildings over three hundred feet in height or for buildings with a height-width ratio greater than five.
2. At two-story entrances or intermediate floors.
3. Where offsets in the building occur.
4. Where transfer columns occur.
5. In any similar circumstances of irregularities or discontinuities in the framing.

#### (c) Distribution of load in self-relieving construction. 

The framing of self-relieving construction may be proportioned on the assumption that connections are fully rigid in resisting moments due to lateral load and that any larger moments due to the gravity loads or due to a combination of gravity and lateral loads will be relieved by deformation of the connection material, provided that:

1. The fasteners shall be capable of developing the full moment capacity of the connection at the allowable unit stress established in subchapter ten of this chapter.
2. The connection shall be capable of resisting the moment due to lateral load, and the shear due to lateral load plus vertical load, all at the allowable unit stresses established in subchapter ten of this chapter.
3. The framing and the building are within the limitations established in subparagraph b of paragraph two of subdivision (b) of this section.
4. The connections shall be detailed to permit the required deformations without fracture, and their capacity to so function shall be verified by test or other means.

#### (d) Structural walls and partitions. 

Walls and partitions, if specifically designed to resist the applied forces, may be considered as contributing to the resistance or rigidity of the structure with regard to horizontal loads.
