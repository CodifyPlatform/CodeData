# Chapter 5 General Building Heights and Areas; Separation of Occupancies

## Section 501 General

### 501.1 Scope

The provisions of this chapter control the height and area of structures hereafter erected and additions to existing structures, including separation of occupancies.

### 501.2 Address Identification

Buildings shall be provided with address numbers or letters in accordance with Section 3-505 of the *Administrative Code* and the rules issued thereunder by the borough president of the borough in which the property is located. Except as otherwise provided by the rules of the borough president in which the property is located, characters shall be a minimum 4 inches (102 mm) high and a minimum of 0.5 inch (12.7 mm) wide. They shall be installed on a contrasting background and be plainly visible from the street or road fronting the property.

### 501.3 Fire Department Access

#### 501.3.1 Frontage

Every building, exclusive of accessory buildings, shall have at least 8 percent of the total perimeter of the building adjoining a street or frontage space. For the purposes of this section, building perimeter shall be measured at that story having the maximum enclosed floor area; and buildings provided with a front yard or front setback no deeper than 30 feet (9144 mm) in compliance with the *New York City Zoning Resolution* shall be considered as adjoining the street or frontage space.

#### 501.3.2 Building Access

Provisions shall be made for access by the Fire Department to every building in accordance with Section 903.2.11.1 of this code and Chapter 5 of the *New York City Fire Code*.

## Section 502 Definitions

### 502.1 Definitions

The following words and terms shall, for the purposes of this chapter and as used elsewhere in this code, have the meanings shown herein.

**AREA, BUILDING.** The area included within surrounding exterior walls (or exterior walls and firewalls) exclusive of vent shafts and courts. Areas of the building not provided with surrounding walls shall be included in the building area if such areas are included within the horizontal projection of the roof or floor above.

**BASEMENT.** A story partly below the grade plane and having less than one-half its clear height (measured from finished floor to finished ceiling) below the grade plane (see "Story" in Section 202 and "Story above grade plane" in this section). A basement shall be considered a story above grade plane.

**CELLAR.** That portion of a building that is partly or wholly underground, and having one-half or more of its clear height (measured from finished floor to finished ceiling) below the grade plane. Cellars shall not be counted as stories in measuring the height of the buildings.

**COMBINED HEAT AND POWER SYSTEMS.** Equipment that simultaneously produces electricity and heat from a single fuel source.

**EQUIPMENT PLATFORM.** An unoccupied, elevated platform used exclusively for mechanical systems or industrial process equipment, including the associated elevated walkways, stairs, alternating tread devices and ladders necessary to access the platform (see [Section 505.5](/dashboard/NYC%20Building%20Code%202014/Chapter%205/General%20Building%20Heights%20and%20Areas;%20Separation%20of%20Occupancies#5055-equipment-platforms)).

**FRONTAGE SPACE.** A street or an open space adjoining a building not less than 30 feet (9144 mm) in any dimension. Such open space shall be accessible from a street by a driveway, lane, private road or alley at least 20 feet (6096 mm) in width. Such open space including accessways shall be permanently maintained free of all obstructions that might interfere with its use by the Fire Department.

**GRADE PLANE.** A reference plane representing the level of the curb as established by the city engineer in the Borough President's office, measured at the center of the front of a building. Where a building faces on more than one street, the grade plane shall be the average of the levels of the curbs at the center of each front.

​	**Exception:** The grade plane shall not be referenced to the level of the curb, but shall be considered the average elevation of the final grade adjoining all exterior walls of a building, calculated from final grade elevations taken at intervals of 10 feet (3048 mm) around the perimeter of the building where:

1. No curb elevation has been legally established on the city map; or
2. Every part of the building is setback more than 25 feet (7620 mm) from a street line.

**HEIGHT, BUILDING.** The vertical distance from the grade plane to the average height of the highest roof surfaces.

**MEZZANINE.** An intermediate level or levels between the floor and ceiling of any story in accordance with [Section 505](/dashboard/NYC%20Building%20Code%202014/Chapter%205/General%20Building%20Heights%20and%20Areas;%20Separation%20of%20Occupancies#section-505-mezzanines-and-equipment-platforms).

**STORY ABOVE GRADE PLANE.** Any story having its finished floor surface entirely above grade plane, except that a basement shall also be considered a story above grade plane (also see definitions of "Story" in Section BC 202 and "Basement" in this section).
