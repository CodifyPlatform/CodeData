The system shall not be prohibited from producing negative or positive pressure. The system to convey ventilation air shall be designed and installed in accordance with Chapter 6.

### **403.2 Outdoor Air Required**

The minimum outdoor airflow rate shall be determined in accordance with [Section 403.3](/dashboard/NYC%20Mechanical%20Code%202014/Chapter%204/Ventilation#4033-outdoor-airflow-rate). Ventilation supply systems shall be designed to deliver the required rate of outdoor airflow to the breathing zone within each occupiable space.

**Exception:** Where a registered design professional demonstrates that an engineered ventilation system design will prevent the maximum concentration of contaminants from exceeding that obtainable by the rate of outdoor air ventilation determined in accordance with [Section 403.3](/dashboard/NYC%20Mechanical%20Code%202014/Chapter%204/Ventilation#4033-outdoor-airflow-rate), the minimum required rate of outdoor air shall be reduced in accordance with such engineered system design.

#### **403.2.1 Recirculation of Air**

The outdoor air required by [Section 403.3](/dashboard/NYC%20Mechanical%20Code%202014/Chapter%204/Ventilation#4033-outdoor-airflow-rate) shall not be recirculated. Air in excess of that required by [Section 403.3](/dashboard/NYC%20Mechanical%20Code%202014/Chapter%204/Ventilation#4033-outdoor-airflow-rate) shall not be prohibited from being recirculated as a component of supply air to building spaces, except that:

1. Ventilation air shall not be recirculated from one dwelling unit to another or to dissimilar occupancies.
2. Supply air to a swimming pool and associated deck areas shall not be recirculated unless such air is dehumidified to maintain the relative humidity of the area at 60 percent or less. Air from this area shall not be recirculated to other uses or occupancies.
3. Where mechanical exhaust is required by Note b of [Table 403.3](/dashboard/NYC%20Mechanical%20Code%202014/Chapter%204/Ventilation#table-4033-minimum-ventilation-rates), recirculation of air from such spaces shall be prohibited. All air supplied to such spaces shall be exhausted, including any air in excess of that required by [Table 403.3](/dashboard/NYC%20Mechanical%20Code%202014/Chapter%204/Ventilation#table-4033-minimum-ventilation-rates).
4. Where mechanical exhaust is required by Note g of [Table 403.3](/dashboard/NYC%20Mechanical%20Code%202014/Chapter%204/Ventilation#table-4033-minimum-ventilation-rates), mechanical exhaust is required and recirculation is prohibited.



#### **403.2.2 Transfer Air**

Except where recirculation from such spaces is prohibited by [Table 403.3](/dashboard/NYC%20Mechanical%20Code%202014/Chapter%204/Ventilation#table-4033-minimum-ventilation-rates), air transferred from occupiable spaces is not prohibited from serving as makeup air for required exhaust systems in such spaces as kitchens, baths, [toilet rooms elevators and smoking lounges. The amount of transfer air and exhaust air shall be sufficient to provide the flow rates as specified in [Section 403.3](/dashboard/NYC%20Mechanical%20Code%202014/Chapter%204/Ventilation#4033-outdoor-airflow-rate). The required outdoor airflow rates specified in [Table 403.3](/dashboard/NYC%20Mechanical%20Code%202014/Chapter%204/Ventilation#table-4033-minimum-ventilation-rates) shall be introduced directly into such spaces or into the occupied spaces from which air is transferred or a combination of both.

### **403.3 Outdoor Airflow Rate**

Ventilation systems shall be designed to have the capacity to supply the minimum outdoor airflow rate determined in accordance with this section. The occupant load utilized for design of the ventilation system shall not be less than the number determined from the estimated maximum occupant load rate indicated in [Table 403.3](/dashboard/NYC%20Mechanical%20Code%202014/Chapter%204/Ventilation#table-4033-minimum-ventilation-rates). Ventilation rates for occupancies not represented in [Table 403.3](/dashboard/NYC%20Mechanical%20Code%202014/Chapter%204/Ventilation#table-4033-minimum-ventilation-rates) shall be those for a listed occupancy classification that is most similar in terms of occupant density, activities and building construction; or shall be determined by an approved engineering analysis. The ventilation system shall be designed to supply the required rate of ventilation air continuously during the period the building is occupied, except as otherwise stated in other provisions of the code.

With the exception of smoking lounges, the ventilation rates in [Table 403.3](/dashboard/NYC%20Mechanical%20Code%202014/Chapter%204/Ventilation#table-4033-minimum-ventilation-rates) are based on the absence of smoking in occupiable spaces. Where smoking is anticipated in a space other than a smoking lounge, the ventilation system serving the space shall be designed to provide ventilation over and above that required by [Table 403.3](/dashboard/NYC%20Mechanical%20Code%202014/Chapter%204/Ventilation#table-4033-minimum-ventilation-rates) in accordance with accepted engineering practice.


**Exceptions**:

1. The occupant load is not required to be determined, based on the estimated maximum occupant load rate indicated in [Table 403.3](/dashboard/NYC%20Mechanical%20Code%202014/Chapter%204/Ventilation#table-4033-minimum-ventilation-rates), where approved statistical data documents the accuracy of an alternate anticipated occupant density.

2. The occupant load used in computing the required ventilation shall be the maximum number who will occupy the room or space simultaneously during any 2-hour period.

3. Dynamic reset (Demand Controlled Ventilation). The system may be designed to reset the design outdoor air intake airflow and/or space or zone airflow as operating conditions change. These conditions include, but are not limited to:

   ​	3.1 Variations in occupancy or ventilation airflow in one or more individual zones for which ventilation airflow requirements will be reset. Note: Examples of measures for estimating such variations include: occupancy scheduled by time of day, a direct count of occupants, or an estimate of occupancy or ventilation rate per person using occupancy sensors such as those based on indoor CO2 concentrations.

   3.2 Variations in the efficiency with which outdoor air is distributed to the occupants under different ventilation system airflows and temperatures.

   3.3 A higher fraction of outdoor air in the air supply due to intake of additional outdoor air for free cooling or exhaust air makeup.
