### **§27-589 Equivalent Systems of Design**

Nothing in this subchapter shall be construed to prohibit the use of any system of design, alternate to those indicated, provided that it can be demonstrated to the satisfaction of the commissioner that such system of design will provide a factor of safety against structural failure consistent with the requirements of articles four through twelve of this subchapter, fire safety in consonance with the requirements of subchapters three through eight of this chapter, and such other characteristics pertinent to the safety of life, health, and property as prescribed in this subchapter or as may be required by the commissioner.

Alternate or equivalent materials or methods of construction shall be subject to the provisions of section 27-133 of article seven of subchapter one of this chapter.

### **§27-590 Deferred Detailing**

Where structural elements are normally detailed on shop or working drawings, the application for the permit shall so state, and issuance of the permit shall be conditioned upon future submission of such shop or working drawings showing the approval of an architect or engineer with regard to such elements, or of a signed statement by an architect or engineer to the effect that such drawings were prepared to his or her satisfaction. In cases where the detailing of structural elements has been made on the basis of fire-resistance ratings, load tables, or similar data as given in manufacturer's catalogues, the application for approval of the plans shall so state and issuance of such acceptance shall be conditional upon submission of a statement by the manufacturer, or of other supporting documentary evidence of accreditation furnished by the manufacturer, attesting to the accuracy of the data and stating that such data were derived in conformance with the provisions of this code. Where the detailing of structural elements has been made on the basis of data published in technical documents of recognized authority issued by, or accredited by, the agency or association promulgating the applicable reference standard cited in this code, such statements will not be required.



## **Article 2 Structural Design-General Requirements**

### **§27-591 Stability**

Except as provided in article twelve of subchapter eleven of this chapter with regard to foundation elements, a building, or any element thereof shall be proportioned to provide a minimum factor of safety of 1.50 against failure by sliding or overturning. The required stability shall be provided solely by the dead load plus any permanent anchorages which may be provided.

### **§27-592 Bracing**

Unless otherwise specified in the reference standards, members used to brace compression members shall be proportioned to resist an axial load of at least two per cent of the total compressive design stress in the member braced, plus any transverse shear therein.

### **§27-593 Secondary Stresses**

Secondary stresses in trusses shall be considered and where of significant magnitude, their effects shall be provided for in the design.

### **§27-594 Combination of Loads**

Dead loads, live loads (including impact) and reduced live loads, where applicable, shall be considered as basic loads. Wind, earthquake, thermal forces, shrinkage, and unreduced live loads (where live load reduction is permitted by subchapter nine of this chapter) shall be considered as loads of infrequent occurrence. Members shall have adequate capacity to resist all applicable combinations of the loads listed in subchapter nine of this chapter, in accordance with the following:

(a) Where design is based on allowable working stresses, the loads as described in subchapter nine of this chapter shall be multiplied by the following factors and the design shall be based on the resulting load values:

1. For combinations of basic loads, only, the factor shall be 1.0, except that for the design of temporary structures (defined as a structure which will be in place six months or less) the factor shall be 0.75.
2. For any combination of one or more basic loads with any one load of infrequent occurrence, the factor shall be 0.75, except that for the design of temporary structures the factor shall be 0.67.
3. For any combination of one or more basic loads with two or more loads of infrequent occurrence, the factor shall be 0.67.

Exception. 

1. The provisions of reference standards RS 10-8 and RS 10-9 relating to increases of allowable unit stresses for short-time loading shall apply.

(b) Where design is based on ultimate strength criteria (including plastic design of steel structures and proportioning of suspended structures), the loads, as described in subchapter nine of this chapter shall be multiplied by the factors indicated in subdivision (e) of [section 27-639](https://up.codes/viewer/new_york_city/nyc-building-code-1968-v1/chapter/10/structural-work#§27-639) of article eleven of this subchapter and in the applicable reference standards. The design shall be based on the resulting load values.

Exceptions.

1. Where combinations of load for which factors are given in the reference standard include the load of wind (or earthquake) the design additionally shall consider combinations of load wherein each other of the loads of frequent occurrence as listed in this paragraph are substituted for the load of wind.
2. The design also shall consider combinations of load wherein two most critical of the loads of infrequent occurrence are combined with the basic loads. For such combination, however, the factors indicated in the reference standards and in subdivision (e) of [section 27-639](https://up.codes/viewer/new_york_city/nyc-building-code-1968-v1/chapter/10/structural-work#§27-639) of article eleven of this subchapter for suspended structures, for the combination of basic loads plus one load of infrequent occurrence may be reduced fifteen per cent.

### **§27-595 Deflection Limitations**

The applicable provisions of the several reference standards cited in this subchapter shall apply. In addition, the total of the dead plus live load vertical deflections (including effects of creep and shrinkage) of members, supporting walls, veneered walls, or partitions constructed of or containing panels of masonry, glass, or other frangible materials shall not exceed 1/360 of the span.



## **Article 3 Adequacy of the Structural Design**

### **§27-596 General**

The structural design of a member or assembly shall be deemed to be adequate if the design computations demonstrate conformance with the applicable standards noted in articles four through twelve of this subchapter. Where, because of practical difficulties, such computations cannot be executed, the structural design may be deemed adequate if the member or assembly is subjected to, and satisfactorily performs under, load tests in accordance with the provisions of subdivision (a) of [section 27-599](https://up.codes/viewer/new_york_city/nyc-building-code-1968-v1/chapter/10/structural-work#§27-599) of this article. Where there is a question as to the adequacy of a completed or partly completed construction, the provisions of sections [27-597](https://up.codes/viewer/new_york_city/nyc-building-code-1968-v1/chapter/10/structural-work#§27-597), [27-598](https://up.codes/viewer/new_york_city/nyc-building-code-1968-v1/chapter/10/structural-work#§27-598), and subdivision (b) of [section 27-599](https://up.codes/viewer/new_york_city/nyc-building-code-1968-v1/chapter/10/structural-work#§27-599) of this article shall apply.

### **§27-597 Questionable Construction**

If, upon inspection, it is found that a construction or any part thereof, as built, shows open cracks, spallings, or other signs of distress; or should inspection records show more significant deficiency of construction; or should laboratory tests on concrete or other materials that have been incorporated into the work indicate deficiency of strength; or should there be a reasonable doubt as to the strength, stability, or adequacy of the construction or any part thereof, such construction may be checked to verify the adequacy thereof either by computation, or by core or load tests conducted in accordance with the provisions of [section 27-598](https://up.codes/viewer/new_york_city/nyc-building-code-1968-v1/chapter/10/structural-work#§27-598) or subdivision (b) of [section 27-599](https://up.codes/viewer/new_york_city/nyc-building-code-1968-v1/chapter/10/structural-work#§27-599) of this article or by any combination of these means. Should the adequacy of construction not be verified within a reasonable time, such construction shall be rejected and shall be demolished or reinforced or rebuilt to be made safe in conformance with the requirements of this code. In the event of a disagreement, the final decision as to the acceptance of the work shall be made by the commissioner. All such tests shall be made without expense to the city.

### **§27-598 Core Tests of Concrete Construction**

The adequacy of the concrete in a building may be ascertained by the recovery and testing of cores. Cores shall be taken and tested in accordance with the procedure described in reference standard RS 10-16. In lieu thereof, cores cast-in-place and originally cured with the parent concrete, or other device acceptable to the architect or engineer designated for controlled inspection and which will produce test specimens simulating the condition of the concrete in place including the size and proportions specified for core specimens may be utilized to demonstrate the adequacy of the concrete in place. The compressive strength so determined shall meet the requirements for strength tests as described in reference standard RS 10-3.

### **§27-599 Load Tests**

#### (a) Prequalifying load tests. 

The provisions of this section shall apply only to load tests made for the purpose of establishing the structural adequacy of members or assemblies before such members or assemblies are incorporated into the work. Load tests for the purpose of establishing the strength of an element or assembly, in place, after construction, shall conform to the requirements of subdivision (b) of this section.

##### (1) TEST SPECIMENS. 

The test specimens shall be a true representation of the units or assemblies to be used in the work and, unless sufficient tests are conducted on differing specimens to interpolate the performance of members of varying characteristics, test specimens shall be substantially identical with the units or assemblies to be used in service. Particular attention shall be given to matching the type and grade of material and, in the case of concrete, the mix, age, curing, and other pertinent variables.

##### (2) SUPPORT CONDITIONS AND INTERACTION. 

Load tests shall be performed in such a manner that the supports for the members or assemblies being tested will simulate the conditions of support in the building, except that conditions of partial fixity may be approximated by condition of full or zero restraint, whichever produces a more severe stress condition in the member being tested. The test conditions shall be such as to obviate all interaction of fills, finishes, partitions, supports, or members whose interaction normally would be neglected in design. Where continuous, multiple, intersecting, or connected members are used in the test, all interacting members shall be simultaneously and fully loaded and additional tests shall be performed under the partial loading conditions specified in subchapter nine of this chapter. Test specimens shall not be unloaded and reloaded or subjected to cyclical loading, except as specifically required by the provisions of this code and except that the adding of increments of additional load to a member already under load and the application of the test load as described in subparagraph b of paragraph three of this subdivision following removal of the test load described in subparagraph a of paragraph three of this subdivision will be permitted.

##### (3) STRENGTH REQUIREMENTS. 

The member or assembly, supported as described in paragraph two of this subdivision, shall be capable of supporting:

a. Without visible damage (other than hairline cracks) its own weight plus a test load equal to one hundred fifty per cent of the design live load plus one hundred fifty per cent of any dead load that will be added at the site; and

b. Without collapse, its own weight plus a test load equal to fifty per cent of its own weight plus two hundred fifty per cent of the design live load plus two hundred fifty per cent of any dead load that will be added at the site. The latter loading shall remain in place for a minimum period of one week. All loading conditions described in subchapter nine of this chapter shall be considered. The design live load shall be the nominal value reduced for contributory area as described in subchapter nine. Except as permitted under paragraph five of this subdivision, units to be tested shall be full size. Load bearing wall and partition assemblies shall be tested both with and without window and door framing where such framing will be included in the final assemblies.

Exception.

1. If the load tests are conducted and the results promulgated in a manner that will permit clear differentiation between the dead and live load components added at the site, then the capacity of the member or assembly without visible damage other than hairline cracks as determined under load test condition in subparagraph a of paragraph three of this subdivision, may be reduced to the weight of the member, plus any dead load that will be added at the site, plus one hundred fifty per cent of the design live load; and the capacity of the member or assembly to resist collapse as determined under load test condition in subparagraph b of paragraph three of this subdivision may be reduced to one hundred fifty per cent of the weight of the member, plus one hundred fifty per cent of any dead load that will be added at the site, plus two hundred fifty per cent of the design live load.

##### (4) DEFLECTION REQUIREMENT. 

With the member or assembly supported as described in paragraph two of this subdivision, and after loading as required by the provisions of subparagraph a of paragraph three of this subdivision and the removal of said load, the percentage of recovery of the deflection caused by the superimposed load shall be at least seventy-five per cent. The deflection under the design live load shall not exceed that permitted in this subchapter.

##### (5) MODEL TESTS. 

Tests on models less than full size may be used to determine the relative intensity, direction, and distribution of stresses and applied loads, but shall not be considered as a proper method for evaluating stresses in, nor the strength of, individual members unless approved by the commissioner for this purpose. Where model analysis is proposed as a means of establishing the structural design, the following conditions shall be met:

a. Analysis shall be made by a firm or a corporation satisfactory to the commissioner.

b. The similitude, scaling, and validity of the analysis shall be attested to by an officer or principal of the firm or corporation making the analysis.

c. A report on the analysis shall be submitted showing test set-ups, equipment, and readings.

#### (b) Load tests of completed construction. 

The provisions of this subdivision shall apply to any type of construction where the appropriate reference standard does not provide for load test of completed construction and the construction is questionable. When the appropriate reference standard provides for such load testing, the provisions of reference standard shall be used.

##### (1) Strength. 

The construction shall be loaded in two stages:

a. With all dead load to which it will be subjected in service plus a superimposed load equal to the design live load reduced as described in subchapter nine of this chapter; and

b. With a total load, including its own weight, equal to one hundred fifty per cent of the total dead load to be supported in service plus one hundred eighty per cent of the design live load, reduced for contributory area as described in subchapter nine of this chapter, which load shall remain in place for a minimum period of twenty-four hours.

#### (a) Controlled inspection. 

Controlled inspection of concrete construction shall include:

##### (1) STRENGTH TESTS. 

Strength tests shall be performed on all structural concrete. The provisions of reference standard RS 10-3 shall apply. A licensed concrete testing laboratory shall, in compliance with reference standards RS 10-17, RS 10-51 and RS 10-52, sample the concrete, make and cure the test specimens at the job site, transport the specimens to the laboratory and test the specimens for compressive strength. Written reports of the results shall be furnished to the architect or engineer designated for controlled inspection and to the concrete producer immediately, but not more than five days following the conclusion of the compression strength tests. Test specimens shall be stored on the job site in an insulated curing box of sufficient size and strength to contain all the specimens made in any four consecutive working days and to protect the specimens from falling over, being jarred or otherwise disturbed during the period of initial curing. The box shall be erected, furnished and maintained by the concrete contractor. Such box shall be equipped to provide the moisture and to regulate the temperature necessary to maintain the proper curing conditions required by reference standard RS 10-52. Such box shall be located in an area free from vibration such as pile driving and traffic of all kinds. No concrete requiring inspection shall be delivered to the site until such storage curing box has been provided. Specimens shall remain undisturbed in the curing box until ready for delivery to the testing laboratory but not less than sixteen hours. Specimens delivered to the laboratory prior to an age of forty-eight hours shall not be demolded prior to delivery. All specimens shall be carefully removed from the box and transported to the laboratory by the licensed concrete testing laboratory in accordance with the provisions of reference standard RS 10-52. All specimens shall be delivered to the laboratory before the laboratory closes at the end of the second working day following the day the specimens were molded. The date of arrival at the laboratory shall be recorded on the specimen test reports. All concrete failing to meet the specified minimum strength requirements shall be rejected by the architect or engineer designated for controlled inspection pending verification of the adequacy of the construction as described in [section 27-598](https://up.codes/viewer/new_york_city/nyc-building-code-1968-v1/chapter/10/structural-work#§27-598) of article three of this subchapter.

##### (2) ADDITIONAL TESTS. 

Each sample of fresh concrete made in accordance with reference standard RS 10-51 for the purpose of molding strength test specimens shall be made under the supervision of the architect or engineer designated for controlled inspection. Each sample shall be tested by the licensed concrete testing laboratory to determine its slump in accordance with reference standard RS 10-49, its entrained air content in accordance with reference standards RS 10-61 and RS 10-62, its unit weight in accordance with reference standards RS 10-63 and RS 10-64 and its temperature. If any of the tests fail to meet the specified requirements, the concrete shall be sampled again and the particular test that failed shall be repeated. If the second test fails to meet the specified requirements, then, with the approval of the architect or engineer designated for controlled inspection, adjustments shall be made to the concrete in the mixer to correct the deficiency. Test specimens shall not be molded from any sample that did not meet the specified requirements nor shall the concrete from which the sample was taken be placed in the structure, provided, however, that such concrete may be used elsewhere in the work where it meets or exceeds the specified requirements, but only with the approval of the architect or engineer designated for controlled inspection. In such case, test specimens shall be molded by the licensed concrete testing laboratory which shall also record the precise location where the concrete was placed in the structure.

##### (3) CONTROLLED INSPECTION LOG BOOK. 

A controlled inspection log book, limited solely to the concrete construction work, readily available to inspectors and representatives of the department, concrete suppliers and the architect and/or engineer of record, shall be maintained at the job site by the architect or engineer designated for controlled inspection, who shall make therein daily entries pertaining to the progress of the work. The entries shall describe, but not be limited to, the location, size and dimensions of the concrete members for which forms were constructed that day; the reinforcement installed in, and the specific locations and time spans of, every concrete placement; the air temperature, wind velocity and direction and other weather conditions during the twenty-four hours after concrete has been placed, speci- fically at eight a.m., noon and four p.m., the protections taken against excessive temperatures and adverse weather conditions at each placement made that day; the methods used, to cure the concrete and the period during which such methods were maintained; the actual hour when forms were stripped and shores were reinstalled and tensioning was applied to all prestressed members. The log shall become a part of the documentation to be filed with the commissioner as provided in [section 27-606](https://up.codes/viewer/new_york_city/nyc-building-code-1968-v1/chapter/10/structural-work#§27-606) and shall include the attestation of the architect or engineer designated for controlled inspection that the concrete construction work complies with the approved plans and the provisions of this code.

#### (b) Other required inspection. 

Quality control or inspection shall be provided with respect to all operations of mixing and placing concrete and reinforcement that are not designated for controlled inspection. In the case of sidewalks, curbs, paving, slabs-on-grade and any work designated in [table 10-1](https://up.codes/viewer/new_york_city/nyc-building-code-1968-v1/chapter/10/structural-work#table_10-1) under the caption "Elements That Are Not Subject to Controlled Inspection" or in [table 10-2](https://up.codes/viewer/new_york_city/nyc-building-code-1968-v1/chapter/10/structural-work#table_10-2) under the caption "Operations on Structural Elements That Are Not Subject to Controlled Inspection," all inspections shall be subject to and in accordance with the requirements of subdivision (b) of section 27-132. If any test to determine the quality or compressive strength of the concrete is required, the fresh concrete shall be sampled and tested for slump, entrained air content, unit weight and temperature. Compression strength test specimens shall be molded only by a licensed concrete testing laboratory or by a person certified by the American Concrete Institute as qualified to perform such function. Attestation shall be executed by the person superintending the use of the material in accordance with the requirements of subdivision (b) of section 27-132 of article seven of subchapter one of this chapter.

Consideration shall be given to the effects of temperature variations, partial and reversible wind loadings, and vibration.

#### (e) Allowable working load. 

The allowable working load in suspenders formed from bridge wire cable shall be computed on the basis of factors equal to one and one-half times dead load plus two and one-half times live load or one and two-tenths times dead load plus two times live load plus two times wind load, applied to the specified, minimum, ultimate strength of the suspender. The allowable working load in suspenders conforming to the materials specifications or several reference standards of this code shall be the allowable working stresses for tension members as prescribed in the applicable reference standard or, for those materials where allowable stresses for tension members are not prescribed, on factors of one and one-half times dead load plus two times live load or one and two-tenths times dead load plus one and one-half times live load, plus one and one-half times wind load, also applied to the specified minimum, ultimate strength of the suspender. In no case, however, shall the factor, applied to the yield strength of the material or to the prestretching or prestressing force, exceed one and one-tenth times dead load plus one and one-quarter times live load.

### **§27-640 Fittings for Wire Cable Suspenders**

Fittings for wire cable suspenders shall be capable of developing the specified minimum ultimate strength of the attached cable or strand without developing stresses in the fitting equal to, or in excess of, the yield strength of the material in the fitting.

## **Article 12 Glass Panels**

### **§27-643 Scope**

The provisions of sections [27-644](https://up.codes/viewer/new_york_city/nyc-building-code-1968-v1/chapter/10/structural-work#§27-644) through [27-648](https://up.codes/viewer/new_york_city/nyc-building-code-1968-v1/chapter/10/structural-work#§27-648) of this article shall apply to the use of glass in the exterior wall of a building and shall be limited to exterior application wherein the glass would not be subjected to any loads normal to the face of glass other than those due to wind. For applications involving human impact, the provisions of [section 27-651](https://up.codes/viewer/new_york_city/nyc-building-code-1968-v1/chapter/10/structural-work#§27-651) of this article shall apply. For other cases, the strength and mode of installation of glass shall conform to accepted industry standards.

### **§27-644 Support for Glass Panels**

Glass shall be firmly held in place. The supports shall be of adequate strength to resist the applicable design wind loads as prescribed in subchapter nine of this chapter.

### **§27-645 Glass Requirements**

Glass shall meet the requirements of reference standard RS 10-68 for the applicable type, size, thickness and quality.

### **§27-646 Thickness of Glass**

Thicknesses of glass panels shall be chosen either on the basis of statistical probability of breakage ( subdivision (a) of this section) or on the basis of [table 10-7](https://up.codes/viewer/new_york_city/nyc-building-code-1968-v1/chapter/10/structural-work#table_10-7), at the designer's option.

#### (a) Statistical probability. 

Thickness of glass panels shall be chosen so that the statistical probability of breakage when the glass is initially subjected to the design wind load specified in table RS 9-5-1 does not exceed the values indicated in [table 10-6](https://up.codes/viewer/new_york_city/nyc-building-code-1968-v1/chapter/10/structural-work#table_10-6). Probability or load factors used for design shall be derived by test. The sufficiency and validity of such test data shall be subject to approval by the commissioner.

#### (b) Alternate requirements. 

Alternative to the requirements of paragraph (a) above, the thickness of glass panels may be chosen from [table 10-7](https://up.codes/viewer/new_york_city/nyc-building-code-1968-v1/chapter/10/structural-work#table_10-7). For glass with assured minimum thickness greater than required by reference standard RS 10-68, the maximum areas in [table 10-7](https://up.codes/viewer/new_york_city/nyc-building-code-1968-v1/chapter/10/structural-work#table_10-7) may be increased in proportion to the assured minimum thickness.

## **Article 13 Paving**

### **§27-652 Paving**

#### *(a) Definitions. 

For the purposes of this article the following terms shall have the following definitions:

##### ASPHALT. 

A dark brown to black bitumen pitch that melts readily and which appears in nature in asphalt beds or is produced as a by-product of the petroleum industry.

##### ASPHALTIC CONCRETE or ASPHALT PAVING. 

A mixture of liquid asphalt and graded aggregate used as a paving material.

##### I-4 MIX. 

A type of heavy duty asphaltic concrete mix containing 0.75 inch (19 mm) nominal maximum size aggregate with 25% to 50% of the aggregate capable of passing through a No. 8 sieve and in which all sand contained in the mix is crushed.

##### RECLAIMED ASPHALT PAVEMENT. 

Asphalt pavement that has been processed for reuse in asphaltic concrete.

#### (b) Reclaimed asphalt pavement content in asphaltic concrete. 

Asphaltic concrete, other than I-4 mix or other approved heavy duty asphaltic concrete mix, shall contain not less than thirty percent reclaimed asphalt pavement, as measured by weight. I-4 mix or other approved heavy duty asphaltic concrete mix shall contain not less than ten percent reclaimed asphalt pavement, as measured by weight. Reclaimed asphalt pavement used in asphaltic concrete shall comply with the version of ASTM D692 or ASTM D1073 specified in chapter 35 of the New York city building code or in the rules of the department. This subdivision shall not apply to asphaltic concrete used in a project where the content of asphaltic concrete is governed by a federal or state law, rule, regulation, guideline, or specification that requires a different composition or to runways, taxiways, or other surfaces utilized by aircraft.
