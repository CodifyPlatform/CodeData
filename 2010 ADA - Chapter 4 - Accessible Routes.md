> #### **403.5.1** Clear Width. 
>
> Except as provided in 403.5.2 and 403.5.3, the clear width of walking surfaces shall be 36 inches (915 mm) minimum.

> >
> > \2. Sliding or folding doors: 5 pounds (22.2 N) maximum.
> >
> > These forces do not apply to the force required to retract latch bolts or disengage other devices that hold the door or gate in a closed position.

#### **Advisory 404.2.9 Door and Gate Opening Force.** 

The maximum force pertains to the continuous application of force necessary to fully open a door, not the initial force needed to overcome the inertia of the door. It does not apply to the force required to retract bolts or to disengage other devices used to keep the door in a closed position.

> #### **404.2.10 Door and Gate Surfaces.** 
>
> Swinging door and gate surfaces within 10 inches (255 mm) of the finish floor or ground measured vertically shall have a smooth surface on the push side extending the full width of the door or gate.

> #### **404.3.1 Clear Width.** 
>
> Doorways shall provide a clear opening of 32 inches (815 mm) minimum in power-on and power-off mode. The minimum clear width for automatic door systems in a doorway shall be based on the clear opening provided by all leaves in the open position.
>
> #### **404.3.2 Maneuvering Clearance.**

## 405 Ramps

### **405.1 General.** 

Ramps on accessible routes shall comply with 405.

**EXCEPTION:** In assembly areas, aisle ramps adjacent to seating and not serving elements required to be on an accessible route shall not be required to comply with 405.

### **405.2 Slope.** 

Ramp runs shall have a running slope not steeper than 1:12.

**EXCEPTION:** In existing sites, buildings, and facilities, ramps shall be permitted to have running slopes steeper than 1:12 complying with Table 405.2 where such slopes are necessary due to space limitations.

| Slope(*[1](https://www.ada.gov/regs2010/2010ADAStandards/2010ADAstandards.htm#sl1)*) | Maximum Rise      |
| ------------------------------------------------------------ | ----------------- |
| Steeper than 1:10 but not steeper than 1:8                   | 3 inches (75 mm)  |
| Steeper than 1:12 but not steeper than 1:10                  | 6 inches (150 mm) |
| *1.* A slope steeper than 1:8 is prohibited.                 |                   |

### **Advisory 405.2 Slope.** 

To accommodate the widest range of users, provide ramps with the least possible running slope and, wherever possible, accompany ramps with stairs for use by those individuals for whom distance presents a greater barrier than steps, e.g., people with heart disease or limited stamina.

### **405.3 Cross Slope.** 

Cross slope of ramp runs shall not be steeper than 1:48.

### **Advisory 405.3 Cross Slope.** 

Cross slope is the slope of the surface perpendicular to the direction of travel. Cross slope is measured the same way as slope is measured (i.e., the rise over the run).

### **405.4 Floor or Ground Surfaces.** 

Floor or ground surfaces of ramp runs shall comply with 302. Changes in level other than the running slope and cross slope are not permitted on ramp runs.

### **405.5 Clear Width.** 

The clear width of a ramp run and, where handrails are provided, the clear width between handrails shall be 36 inches (915 mm) minimum.

**EXCEPTION:** Within employee work areas, the required clear width of ramps that are a part of common use circulation paths shall be permitted to be decreased by work area equipment provided that the decrease is essential to the function of the work being performed.

### **405.6 Rise.** 

The rise for any ramp run shall be 30 inches (760 mm) maximum.

### **405.7 Landings.** 

Ramps shall have landings at the top and the bottom of each ramp run. Landings shall comply with 405.7.

### **Advisory 405.7 Landings.** 

Ramps that do not have level landings at changes in direction can create a compound slope that will not meet the requirements of this document. Circular or curved ramps continually change direction. Curvilinear ramps with small radii also can create compound cross slopes and cannot, by their nature, meet the requirements for accessible routes. A level landing is needed at the accessible door to permit maneuvering and simultaneously door operation.

## 410 Platform Lifts

### **410.1 General.** 

Platform lifts shall comply with ASME A18.1 (1999 edition or 2003 edition) (incorporated by reference, see "Referenced Standards" in Chapter 1). Platform lifts shall not be attendant-operated and shall provide unassisted entry and exit from the lift.

### **Advisory 410.1 General.** 

Inclined stairway chairlifts and inclined and vertical platform lifts are available for short-distance vertical transportation. Because an accessible route requires an 80 inch (2030 mm) vertical clearance, care should be taken in selecting lifts as they may not be equally suitable for use by people using wheelchairs and people standing. If a lift does not provide 80 inch (2030 mm) vertical clearance, it cannot be considered part of an accessible route in new construction.

The ADA and other Federal civil rights laws require that accessible features be maintained in working order so that they are accessible to and usable by those people they are intended to benefit. Building owners are reminded that the ASME A18 Safety Standard for Platform Lifts and Stairway Chairlifts requires routine maintenance and inspections. Isolated or temporary interruptions in service due to maintenance or repairs may be unavoidable; however, failure to take prompt action to effect repairs could constitute a violation of Federal laws and these requirements.

### **410.2 Floor Surfaces.** 

Floor surfaces in platform lifts shall comply with 302 and 303.

### **410.3 Clear Floor Space.** 

Clear floor space in platform lifts shall comply with 305.

### **410.4 Platform to Runway Clearance.** 

The clearance between the platform sill and the edge of any runway landing shall be 1 inch (32 mm) maximum.

### **410.5 Operable Parts.** 

Controls for platform lifts shall comply with 309.

### **410.6 Doors and Gates.** 

Platform lifts shall have low-energy power-operated doors or gates complying with 404.3. Doors shall remain open for 20 seconds minimum. End doors and gates shall provide a clear width 32 inches (815 mm) minimum. Side doors and gates shall provide a clear width 42 inches (1065 mm) minimum.

**EXCEPTION:** Platform lifts serving two landings maximum and having doors or gates on opposite sides shall be permitted to have self-closing manual doors or gates.
