##### *§ 28-320.3.6.3 Deductions from reported annual building emissions for clean distributed energy resources.*

*For calendar years 2024 through 2029, a deduction from the reported annual building emissions shall be authorized based upon the calculated output of a clean distributed energy resource located at, on, in, or directly connected to the building subject to the report. The department shall promulgate rules to set forth how such deduction shall be calculated, in accordance with the following:*

1. *For a clean distributed energy resource that generates electricity, the department shall establish separate calculations for each type of commercially available clean distributed energy resource, which shall not be revised more frequently than once every three years.*
2. *For a clean distributed energy resource that stores electricity, the deduction shall be based on the size of the resource and its ability to reduce greenhouse gas emissions during designated peak periods.* 

#### § 28-320.3.7 Reports. 

*By May 1, 2025, and by May 1 of every year thereafter, the owner of a covered building shall file with the department a report, certified by a registered design professional, prepared in a form and manner and containing such information as specified in rules of the department, that for the previous calendar year such building is either:*

1. *In compliance with the applicable building emissions limit established pursuant to section 28-320.3; or 14*
2. *Not in compliance with such applicable building emissions limit, along with the amount by which such building exceeds such limit.*

*An owner may apply for an extension of time to file an annual report required by section 28-320.3.7 in accordance with this section and the rules of the department. An extension may be granted where the owner is unable to file the certified report by the scheduled due date despite such owner’s good faith efforts, as documented in such application. An extension granted pursuant to this section shall not modify the owner’s obligation to comply with the applicable emission limits for such calendar year.*

#### *§ 28-320.3.8 Continuing requirements.*

#### *§ 28-320.7. Adjustment to applicable annual building emissions limit.* 

*The department, in consultation with the mayor’s office of long term planning and sustainability or any other agency designated by the mayor, may grant an adjustment of the annual building emissions limit applicable to a covered building in existence on the effective date of this article or for which a permit for the construction of such building was issued prior to such effective date, provided that the owner is complying with the requirements of this article to the maximum extent practicable.*

1. *Such an adjustment may be granted upon a specific determination that:*

   *1.1. Capital improvements are necessary for strict compliance with the limit set forth in section 28-320.3 and it is not reasonably possible to make such improvements due to (i) a constraint imposed by another provision of law including but not limited to designation as a landmark, landmark site, interior landmark, or within a historic district pursuant to chapter 3 of title 25 of the administrative code, or (ii) a physical condition of the building or building site including but not limited to lack of access to energy infrastructure, space constraints, or lack of access to a space within a building covered by a lease in existence on the effective date of this section;*

   *1.2. The owner has made a good faith effort to purchase greenhouse gas offsets to comply with section 28-320.3 but a sufficient quantity is not available at a reasonable cost; and*

   *1.3. The owner has availed itself of all available city, state, federal, private and utility incentive programs related to energy reduction or renewable energy for which it reasonably could participate.*

2. *Such an adjustment may be granted upon a specific determination that:*

The cost of financing capital improvements necessary for strict compliance with the limit set forth in section 28-320.3 would prevent the owner of a building from earning a reasonable financial return on the use of such building or the building is subject to financial hardship as defined in this article. In evaluating the ability of an owner to earn a reasonable financial return, the department may consider future savings expected from such capital improvements;*

   *2.2. The owner is not eligible for any program funded by the city or enabled by a local law that provides financing for the purpose of energy reduction or sustainability measures. Proof of ineligibility for financing must be demonstrated by rejection from any such program funded by the city or enabled by a local law or an affidavit explanation why such owner could not reasonably participate in such programs;*

   *2.3. The owner has made a good faith effort to purchase greenhouse gas offsets or renewable energy credits to comply with section 28-320.3 but a sufficient quantity is not available at a reasonable cost; and*

   *2.4. The owner has availed itself of all available city, state, federal, private and utility incentive programs related to energy reduction or renewable energy for which it reasonably could participate.*

The adjustment shall result in a required building emissions limit that is 70 percent of the calendar year 2018 building emissions for the covered building. Such adjustment may be granted where:*

1. *The owner of a covered building demonstrates that the building emissions in excess of the building emissions limit is attributable to special circumstances related to the use of the building, including but not limited to 24 hour operations, operations critical to human health and safety, high density occupancy, energy intensive communications technologies or operations, and energy-intensive industrial processes;*
2. *The owner of a covered building demonstrates that the energy performance of the covered building is equivalent to a building in compliance with the New York city energy conservation code in effect on January 1, 2015; and*
