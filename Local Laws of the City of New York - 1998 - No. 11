### § 32-03 Periodic Inspection of Exterior Walls and Appurtenances of Buildings.

#### (a) Definitions. 

##### Critical examination. 

Critical examination means an examination conducted to review the exterior of a building and all parts thereof to determine whether the exterior walls and the appurtenances thereto are safe, unsafe, or safe with a repair and maintenance program and whether, in the judgment of a Registered Architect or Professional Engineer, they require remedial work.

##### Unsafe condition.

Unsafe condition means a condition of a building wall, any appurtenances thereto or part thereof that is dangerous to persons or property and requires prompt remedial action. In addition, any condition which was reported as safe with a repair and maintenance program in an earlier report and which is not corrected at the time of the current inspection shall be reported as an unsafe condition.

##### Safe.

Safe means a condition of a building wall, any appurtenances thereto or any part thereof not requiring repair or maintenance to sustain the structural integrity of the exterior of the building and that will not become unsafe during the next five years. Safe with a repair and maintenance program. Safe with a repair and maintenance program means a condition of a building wall, any appurtenances thereto or any part thereof that is safe at the time of inspection, but requires repairs or maintenance during the next five years in order to prevent its deterioration during that five year period into an unsafe condition.

##### Standard reporting period.

The standard reporting period is the time interval established by the Commissioner of Buildings for the filing of each successive report for each successive critical examination of every building subject to the requirements of Local Law 10 for the Year 1980 as amended by Local Law 11 for the Year 1998.
